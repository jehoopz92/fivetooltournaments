            Hi, Im Tanner Reboulet and I grew up in Indianapolis, IN. Playing travel baseball was easily one of the best experiences throughout my childhood. From playing some of the best teams across the country, to playing at some of the best facilities you can name, to even playing in front of some of the biggest collegiate scouts . Being in that dugout, and being able to compete with my teammates for an opportunity to play at the next level… Those memories and experiences with my teammates will last a lifetime. By creating 5-Tool Tournaments, we’re determined to get today’s kids that same opportunity and experience. We are excited to continue our love for the game of baseball with 5-Tool Tournaments.

            Hi, my name is Brandon Capps. I am a Greenville native and love the
            game of Baseball. I currently reside north of Travelers Rest with my
            fiancé and two dogs. I began to love this game at a young age; by 4
            I was picking up a ball and a bat. I worked my way to a Little
            League state championship, a few high school region championships,
            and ended up with a few accolades. Still wanting to continue my love
            for the game, I began coaching at a small baseball academy in
            Spartanburg, SC. As a coach I have won some coaching championships
            with my 16u team. My passion for the game has brought a lot of
            amazing memories that I will forever cherish. With 5-Tool I hope to
            continue those memories. We will strive to be the best. With that
            being said I am happy to be apart of the 5-Tool team.
